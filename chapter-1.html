    Chapter 1: Introduction to Git and GitHub
    <p>
      In this chapter, we will cover the basics of Git and GitHub, including
      what they are, how they work, and why they are important for version
      control and collaboration in software development.
    </p>
    <h2>What is Git?</h2>
    <p>
      Git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple
      developers to work on a project simultaneously without interfering with
      each other's changes. It tracks changes in files and allows you to revert
      to previous versions if needed.
    </p>
    <h2>What is GitHub?</h2>
    <p>
      GitHub is a web-based platform that uses Git for version control. It
      provides a user-friendly interface for managing Git repositories and
      facilitates collaboration among developers. GitHub also offers features
      like issue tracking, pull requests, and project management tools.
